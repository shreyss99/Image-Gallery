# Image-Gallery
Hi everybody !!
This is Shrey here.
I like Web Development and Big Data Analytics.

This is about implementing an Image Gallery in JAVA with features like displaying stored images, next and previous images, slideshow of images and allowing a user to select an image of his / her choice from folder.
